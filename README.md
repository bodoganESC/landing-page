# ULTRAKILL - Landing page

This page is designed to test my skills using flexbox, in the style of ULTRAKILL.

All credits for the game and imagery go to NewBlood, this is a fan-made website
not meant to replace an official one, nor try to use the game's name for
commercial purposes. Love to NewBlood and Hakita.

Credits for the images go to the ULTRAKILL Wiki (https://ultrakill.wiki.gg/),
to the background image from Wallhaven from a deleted user
(https://wallhaven.cc/w/p9lq3m) and to the guy that made the V1 balling gif.
